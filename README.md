# Migration Map

***

## Description
This website was created as part of the MITxPro course.

This website uses the Mapbox API and Movebank API to map the migration movements of an albatross on a world map.

## How to Run
This project may be loaded in a browser. However, the user should replace the Mapbox API and the Movebank API with their own APIs keys.

## Roadmap of Future Improvements
I would love to add more animal migrations to the map.
Leave a line on the map so you can see the paths each animal has taken.
Add some UI for filtering different animals.
